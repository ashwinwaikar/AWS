# **What is cloud computing?**

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

# **Types of cloud computing services**

The most common and widely adopted cloud computing services are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

**What is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**

IaaS is a cloud computing model where virtualized infrastructure is offered to, and managed for, businesses by external cloud providers. With IaaS, companies can outsource for storages, servers, data center space and cloud networking components connected through the internet, offering similar functionality as that of an on-premises infrastructure. Some examples of the wide usage of IaaS are automated, policy-driven operations such as backup, recovery, monitoring, clustering, internal networking, website hosting, etc.

The service provider is responsible for building the servers and storage, networking firewalls/ security, and the physical data center. Some key players offering IaaS are Amazon EC2, [Microsoft Azure](https://www.trianz.com/partnerships/cloud/microsoft-azure-cloud-services), Google Cloud Platform, GoGrid, Rackspace, DigitalOcean among others.

**What is Platform as a Service (PaaS):**

PaaS builds on IaaS. Here, cloud vendors deliver computing resources, both cloud software and hardware infrastructure components like middleware and operating systems, required to develop and test applications. The PaaS environment enables cloud users (accessing them via a webpage) to install and host data sets, development tools and business analytics applications, apart from building and maintaining necessary hardware. Some key players offering PaaS are Bluemix, CloudBees, Salesforce.com, Google App Engine, Heroku, AWS, Microsoft Azure, OpenShift, [Oracle Cloud](https://www.trianz.com/partnerships/cloud/oracle-partner), SAP and OpenShift.

**What is Software as a Service (SaaS):**

SaaS is special in that it incorporates both IaaS and Paas. Here, the cloud service provider delivers the entire software suite as a pay-per-use model. SaaS lets users easily access software applications -- such as emails -- over the internet. Most common examples of SaaS are Microsoft Office 360, AppDynamics, Adobe Creative Cloud, Google G Suite, Zoho, Salesforce, Marketo, Oracle CRM, Pardot Marketing Automation, and SAP Business ByDesign.

# **Types of cloud deployments**

There are three types of cloud deployments categorized based on an organization&#39;s ability to manage and secure assets as well as business needs.

**Public cloud:**

Public cloud, in general, is SaaS services offered to users over the internet. It is the most economical option for users in which the service provider bears the expenses of bandwidth and infrastructure. It has limited configurations, and the cost is determined by usage capacity. That said, the limitations of the public cloud are its lack of SLA specifications. Despite high reliability, lower costs, zero maintenance and on-demand scalability, the public cloud is not suitable for organizations operating with sensitive information as they have to comply with stringent security regulations.

**Private cloud:**

As the name suggests, the private cloud is used by large organizations to build and manage their own data centers for specific business and IT needs/ operations. The private cloud provides more control over customizability, scalability and flexibility, while improving security of assets and business operations. This sort of infrastructure can be built on premises or outsourced to a third party service provider â€“ either way, it has the ability to maintain the hardware and software environment over a private network solely for the owner. Large- and medium-scale financial enterprises and government agencies typically opt for private clouds.

**Hybrid cloud:**

Hybrid cloud is the combination of a private and public cloud, providing for more flexibility to businesses while having control over critical operations and assets, coupled with improved flexibility and cost efficiency. The hybrid cloud architecture enables companies to take advantage of the public cloud as and when necessary due to their easy workload migration. For instance, businesses can use the public cloud for running high-volume applications like emails, and utilize private clouds for sensitive assets like financials, data recovery, and during scheduled maintenance and rise in demand.

# **Benefits of cloud computing**

Cloud computing offers plenty of benefits. The top 10 are as follows:

1. **Instant scalability:**

Cloud computing enables immediate scalability of infrastructure capacity depending on the business need. It is like having an unlimited IT resource, which can be scaled up and/ or down to meet user demands

1. **Anywhere accessibility:**

A lot of factors have enabled globalization, and a key one is technology and high-speed internet connectivity. Cloud empowers enterprises to deploy their applications across the globe so they can service their customers at a fraction of the cost of a traditional brick-and-motor businesses. Due to lower latency, customers around the world get an identical digital experience while using the applications

1. **Increased speed and operational agility:**

Today, to cope with competition, businesses must have the ability to instantly scale their cloud capacity by accessing bandwidth demands from remote servers of a particular cloud service provider. If the business demand is more, the enterprise can turn up its computing capacity and IT resources availability with the click of a button. Such an ability improves organizational agility, productivity and efficiency making scope to experiment with new ideas and thereby, offering competitive advantage and the ability for the organization of any size to disrupt the market

1. **Reduced expenditure:**

With the cloud, enterprises can focus on building their business rather than investing in hardware infrastructure and data centers that either remain idle, or underutilized. Cloud costs, however, depend on the consumption -- a variable expense

1. **Automatic updates/ patches:**

When enterprises deal with several different kinds of software, operating systems, and applications from various vendors for their everyday operations, they have to have software and security updates rolled out from time to time. This is a very time-consuming process and the downtime for system maintenance means loss of productivity. A cloud service provider or a managed service provider can take care of these automatically, saving time and manual effort on maintenance.

1. **Disaster recovery:**

The world is going digital, making robust backup and disaster recovery crucial for business of all sizes. However, on-premises investments for disaster recovery are things of the past today. Especially since cloud computing helps both large corporations and small enterprises save time and effort involved in this exercise

1. **High security:**

Protecting sensitive, personally identifiable and/ or financial information is a considerable challenge for CIOs. Advanced cloud security features, however, have reduced the risks of information loss and cyber stealth

1. **Reduced carbon footprint:**

Last, but not the least, cloud infrastructure significantly reduces power, IT infrastructure, and resource consumption by offering resources as per demand, thereby reducing e-waste and adverse impact on the environmental

1. **Flexibility**** :**

From closed cabins to bringing your internet-enabled devices to work, irrespective of the device type and/ or global location, cloud offers vast flexibility and empowerment to businesses as well as to their employees

1. **Enterprise collaboration:**

Company information no longer exists in silos (except confidential ones, of course). Centralized documentation control on cloud-based, file-sharing and social communication apps (like Slack, Yammer, etc) offers transparency and visibility into work processes, streamlining information flow and enabling better collaboration between teams, departments and employees seated in different time zones -- all of which leads to improved productivity and bottom line.
